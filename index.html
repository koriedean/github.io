# Inadequate Plumbing in North Carolina

Created and reported by Korie Dean and Taylor Buck

*MEJO390 Final Project*

## Project goal

The goal of this project was to localize nationwide data on inadequate plumbing to North Carolina and determine what actions can be taken to address the issue at the county and state levels. The story analyzes the number of homes in North Carolina without adequate plumbing using data from a variety of sources, including Kaiser Health News, the American Community Survey and the Decennial survey data at the state, county and tract levels.
